## How to use

Once installed, click the "XP Tracker" button in the navbar. The panel shows your current task progress and updates automatically. Click on any resource to preview XP rates before starting a task.

Enter a target level in any card and hit "Calc" to see exactly how many actions and how much time you need to reach it.
